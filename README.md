## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" is used.

# Please remember to change the working directory before running the code, otherwise it will not work.

## Making Plots

This repository has forked and cloned the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)


For the following plots, I have:
* Constructed the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Named each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Created a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
the `plot1.png` plot.

* Added the PNG file and R code file to my git repository


The four plots are shown below.
